It was forked from Cinder , which has a more modern, sans-serif look. (Vlinder is Dutch for \u201cButterfly.\u201d I could not think of anything else to name it.) The font families are EB Garamond and Victor Mono under an open font licence for that classic book look. Vlinder Academia is under MIT licence and you are welcome to personalize it or adapt it to another site generator. The drop caps seen in the paragraph above are a bit of a hack; they\u2019re implemented on the quote markdown operator ( > text ). The flourishes on headers and links are completely automatic. \u201cCurled quotes\u201d and apostrophes are only automatic when the smarty extension is enabled, or you may type them manually in the markdown. There are some good MkDocs themes available, but none that quite nail that \u201cacademic paper from 1892\u201d look I desire. I also find that many websites (including but not limited to the themes) simply set their text size far too small. Hence, I chose a good base and started hacking away at the CSS myself. The colors were picked from the \u201ccrest\u201d and \u201cmagma\u201d Seaborn gradients. If you print this page (including to PDF), the accent colors will be flattened to black and white and the sidebars will be removed. The author of this theme is 0xabad1dea (she/her, the hex is silent). Installation and Use Please see the Cinder docs for the nitty-gritty of installing the theme to your MkDocs (it\u2019s not hard, just mentally substitute \u201cvlinder\u201d for \u201ccinder\u201d) and configuring some optional functionality that I frankly don\u2019t care about. Here are italics and here is bold and here is code and here is a link . The header at the top of the page is H1 and the one just above this is H2. Only the H1 and H2 headers are centered and colored, the others are left-aligned and black with no flourishes. The above is a publisher\u2019s flourish that was especially designed for texts typeset in Garamond, taken from this public domain specimen book . Images included through markdown syntax are centered and 75% of column width; use HTML markup if you need more control over how an image is displayed. \u201cHere is a quote that actually opens with a quotation mark.\u201d Note This theme supports the \u201cadmonition\u201d markdown extension for inline call-outs. Warning Without the extension enabled for your site, these will render poorly. Danger You can include arbitrary markdown within an admonition, But the results may get a bit silly. This shall serve both to demonstrate a basic code block and explain how to enable built-in extentions: simply add the following to your mkdocs.yml : markdown_extensions: - admonition - smarty The syntax for an admonition is as follows: !!! note This theme supports the \"admonition\" markdown extension for inline call-outs. Digits have been configured to render as tabular (consistent width) even outside of code blocks.
